### Docker

- Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

- An open platform for distributed applications for developers and sysadmins.

- Docker is an application which provides nice isolated, layered, portable, fast environment (for development and deployment) with less overhead (compared to VMs).
