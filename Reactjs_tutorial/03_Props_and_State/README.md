## Props and State

### Props
- **Props** shorthand for Properties.
- By using Props data can be passed from parent to child component.
- Props are immutable.
- Even functions may also be passed in as props.

### State
- **State** is mutable.
- Changes to State trigger render method of component.
- State is a private feature and it strictly belongs to a single component.
- State of a component is initialized inside a constructor.
- Component with State are called as stateful component.
